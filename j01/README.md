# Wireless Cooking

Everyday technology is advancing more and more, integrating itself into everyday objects, some that may come as a surprise to us at first. I recently got a new stove which expresses this idea. Allowing the user to control/operate their appliance without having to manually interface with it.

The application upon launch demonstrates "**Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**", or [the usability guideline for content and visual design]([https://www.geappliances.com/connect](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)) to not overwhelm new users. This is very important considering that most users haven't needed to consider using an application for something as traditional as a stove. ([SmartHQ](https://www.geappliances.com/connect))

The dark background, coupled with the bright pink allows our eyes to naturally gravitate towards the next step in connecting our application. After which the application continues the theme of  "**Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**" by offering several images to correctly allow the user to select their appliance. The interface guides them through every step of the way.

I would like to draw attention to the last image since, I at first found it rather odd that there would be a question in regards to the physical interface of your appliance but being presented with the final page it began to make sense.

The entire time the application is shaping the **conceptual model** to be able to match the user's **mental model** in order to make the application not only more **learnable** for the user but to let them more **effectively** use the app. This control panel mimics the same information that you would expect from the physical appliance with a few added details. There is immediate **feedback** since you are able to monitor the temperature as well as see how much time is left considering that the intended purpose is to be able to preheat or cook food when you are not at home, all at the touch of your finger tips. It is also clearly indicated how to turn off the stove using **natural mapping** and your **standard**.

It is important that new users are able to easily use your application as an alternative method of interfacing with your household appliance. Especially considering all that could go wrong when you are physically present and operating the appliance now with the added risk of not being present. Being able to give your users trust and comfort through the **feedback** given by your application is crucial. Not much can be said about how to improve the application since this feature is more geared towards convenience rather than necessity. Providing the user more information would help in giving the user as much control and information as possible for everything that is happening with their application while they are away would be the right path to go.
